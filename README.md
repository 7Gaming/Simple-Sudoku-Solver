# Simple-Sudoku-Solver
Winforms project to solve simple sudoku puzzles!
I made this in a few hours for my local programming group on meetup.
It doesn't have advanced solving techniques programmed in or a brute force method, but it's still enough to solve simple puzzles! To use simply fire up, clear the board, and click away! Left clicking on a box will increase the box's value and right clicking will decrease it.
